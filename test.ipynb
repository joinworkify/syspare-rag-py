Ensure the left and right brake pedals are connected with the brake pedal connector lock.\\n2.  Reduce the engine speed.\\n3.  Depress the clutch pedal completely to disengage the clutch.\\n4.  Depress the brake to stop the tractor.\\n5.  Shift the reverser lever to the N (neutral) position.\\n\\n**Safety of a Child:**\\n\\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of a child. Children are often attracted to tractors but do not understand the dangers.\\n\\n*   Never assume a child will remain where last seen.\\n*   Keep children out of the operating area and under the watchful care of an adult other than the operator.\\n*   Be alert; if a child enters the work area, stop the tractor immediately.\\n*   Never allow a child to ride on the tractor. They can fall off and be seriously injured or interfere with safe tractor operation.\\n*   Never allow a child under 16 years old to operate the tractor. Children 16 and under should only operate the tractor under close parental supervision and proper instruction.\\n*   Be extremely careful when backing the tractor. Before and during backing, look back and downward. A child may be in the path.\\n*   Use extra care when approaching blind spots or areas that may obscure the vision of a child or other hazard.\\n*   Never allow a child to play on the tractor or implement.\\n*   Keep children away from hot or running engines.\\n\\n**Operate the Tractor on Slopes:**\\n\\nOn a slope, the tractor is less stable and more prone to tip over, possibly leading to serious injury or death.\\n\\n*   Remain very cautious while operating the tractor on any slope.\\n*   Operate up and down, not across, slopes.\\n*   Remove obstructions such as rocks.\\n*   Watch for ditches or holes. Uneven terrain can overturn the tractor. Tall grass can hide hazards.\\n*   Place the transmission in low range and engage the four-wheel drive when climbing or descending slopes.\\n*   Always keep the tractor in gear when going downhill to take advantage of engine braking action.\\n*   Keep all movements slow and gradual. Do not make sudden changes in speed or direction. Rapid engagement or disengagement of the clutch can cause the front of the tractor to lift and rapidly tip over backwards, which can cause serious injury.\\n*   Avoid starting or stopping on a slope.\\n*   If you lose traction, push the Power Take-Off (PTO) switch to the OFF position and proceed slowly straight down the slope.\\n*   To avoid upset, move backward up a steep slope. Backing on a slope is difficult; do not attempt to continue if it feels unsafe.\\n*   Avoid extremely steep slopes.\\n*   When moving forward to get out of a ditch, deep mud, or when traveling on a steep slope, the risk of the tractor upsetting backward is high. Always move backward to get out of these situations.\\n*   In four-wheel drive mode, use special caution to avoid false confidence in the ability to climb slopes.\\n*   To improve stability on a slope, select the widest possible tire tread width.\\n*   Observe the operation manual for appropriate weighting recommendations.\\n',\n",

Use a lower speed on slopes.\\n*   Never attempt to shift on a slope. The tractor can suddenly go downhill out of control.\\n*   Avoid rapidly increasing or decreasing the tractor speed.\\n*   Do not move the range shift lever to neutral (N) when on a slope. Shifting into neutral can result in loss of control.\\n*   Starting the tractor with the front end uphill can cause the front to jump off the ground, creating an extreme danger.

       " 'Okay, I will clean the provided text and provide a concise summary of the table information.\\n\\n**Cleaned Text:**\\n\\n**SAFETY: Protective Structure**\\n\\nThe tractor is equipped with a Protective Structure (likely a Roll-Over Protective Structure - ROPS) which must be in fully functional condition. Check overhead clearance carefully before driving under power or under low-hanging objects, before entering or leaving areas, or in any situation where the Protective Structure could be struck. This can result in serious injury. Always maintain the Protective Structure in its original condition. Replace the Protective Structure if it has been damaged. Damage can weaken the structure and endanger the operator\\'s safety. Contact your local tractor dealer for technical assistance. Use only genuine parts to replace any part of the Protective Structure. Never attach ropes or chains to the Roll Over Protective Structure (ROPS) for pulling. Although the Protective Structure is designed to provide operator protection in accordance with standards at the time of manufacture, ALWAYS take necessary safety precautions.\\n\\n**Safe Practices for Tractor Servicing**\\n\\nBefore starting any service work:\\n\\n*   Park the tractor on solid, level ground.\\n*   Engage the parking brake securely (see section on \"Lock and Set the Parking Brake\").\\n*   Lower the implement to the ground.\\n*   Move all levers to the neutral position (N).\\n*   Press the Power Take-Off (PTO) switch to the OFF position.\\n*   Shut off the engine and remove the key.\\n\\nOnly trained personnel should service the tractor. Understand the instructions in the Operation Manual before servicing. Always keep a first aid kit and a fire extinguisher readily available. Before touching the engine, muffler, radiator, radiator cap, or other potentially hot parts, wait until the tractor has fully cooled down. Keep the tractor and the surrounding area free of grass, leaves, or other debris buildup.\\n\\n**Fuel Safety (Diesel)**\\n\\nUse extreme care when handling diesel fuel. Diesel fuels are extremely flammable and their vapors are explosive. Close the fuel shutoff valve before working on the fuel system. Make sure to shut off the engine before refueling. After refueling, replace the fuel filler cap securely and wipe off any spilled diesel fuel before starting the engine, as diesel fuel may cause a fire or explosion. Do not smoke while refueling. Keep any spark or open flame away from the fuel tank. Never refuel the tractor indoors because diesel fuel vapors will accumulate in the area. Never store fuel containers or the tractor indoors where there is an open flame or spark, such as near a gas water heater, space heater, or furnace.\\n\\n**Battery Safety**\\n\\nDo not smoke while working around the battery. Keep any sparks or open flame away from the battery. The battery emits hydrogen and oxygen, particularly during charging, which can pose an explosion hazard. Prior to jump-starting a tractor with a fully discharged battery, read and follow all instructions in the \"SERVICE THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM\" chapter of the Operation Manual.\\n',\n",

Reconnect it last.\\n*   Only qualified personnel should mount tires onto rims.\\n*   Always maintain correct tire air pressure. Avoid exceeding the tire pressure limits in the operation manual.\\n*   Tighten wheel nuts to the proper torque using the correct procedure.\\n*   Keep the tractor stable while adjusting wheel spacing or tire tread width.\\n*   Avoid working under hydraulically supported equipment. Hydraulic systems can leak, settle, or be accidentally lowered. If working underneath is unavoidable, use a stand or lift apparatus with sufficient capacity.\\n*   High-pressure hydraulic fluid can penetrate skin, causing serious injury. Before disconnecting any hydraulic line, fully release internal pressure. Before applying pressure to the hydraulic system, ensure all connections are tight and all hoses and lines are free from damage.\\n*   Search for leaks with a piece of cardboard. Protect hands and body from high-pressure fluid. If an accident occurs, see a doctor immediately. Any fluid injected into the skin must be surgically removed within a few hours, or gangrene may result.\\n*   Check brake operation frequently. Adjust and service brakes as needed.\\n*   Keep all safety devices in place and ensure the tractor and attachments are in safe working condition.\\n*   Avoid tampering with the engine governor or overspeeding the engine. Excessive engine speeds are dangerous.\\n*   Observe proper waste disposal methods. Determine the proper disposal method from your local Environmental Protection Agency. Dispose of waste in an environmentally safe fashion, following applicable laws.\\n*   Avoid using food or beverage containers that could mislead someone into drinking hazardous substances. Properly dispose of containers immediately after use.\\n*   Always refer to the Operation Manual for detailed instructions and safety information.\\n\\n**Summary of Safety Information:**\\n\\nThis section outlines critical safety precautions for operating and maintaining the equipment.
