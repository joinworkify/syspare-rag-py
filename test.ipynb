       "\"INTRODUCTION \\nThank you for purchasing Yanmar tractor product that has been designed and \\nmanufactured based on the Yanmar state-of-the-art technology and rich \\nexpertise in developing and manufacturing products. \\nHandle the tractor correctly by following the instructions in the operation manual \\nso that the tractor will provide long years of reliable and predictable service. \\nThe operation manual constitutes an indispensable part of the Yanmar tractor \\nproduct. Always keep the operation manual readily accessible. \\nCarefully study the operation manual to get familiar with the instructions and \\ninformations contained in the operation manual. The instructions and \\ninformations are helpful in using the tractor correctly and safely, avoiding \\npersonal injury and other accidents during operation and servicing of the tractor. \\nWhen using any implement together with the tractor, also carefully study the \\noperation manual of the implement so that the operator can use the implement \\nsafely, correctly and efficiently. \\nThe operation manual is organized with sections arranged in a particular order \\nso that the operator can better understand the safety messages and the controls \\non the tractor to help the operator operate the tractor correctly and safely. The \\noperation manual will also help the operator answer questions about operation \\nand servicing. \\nThe tractor shown in the operation manual may somewhat differ from the actual \\ntractor. The operation manual will still assist the operator in understanding the \\ninstructions associated with the tractor. Before delivery of the tractor, your \\nYanmar Tractor dealer has performed a pre-delivery check to ensure that the \\ntractor can long remain problem free. \\nUnless otherwise specified, the illustration shows YM351R. \\nAll information, descriptions, specifications, drawings, illustrations, and \\npictures in this manual are based on the latest information available at the \\ntime this manual was published. Yanmar reserves the right to make \\nchanges at any time without prior notice. \\n1 'YM351R/YM358R Operation Manual\""
